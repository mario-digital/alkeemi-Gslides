# Monitoring and Observability

## Monitoring Stack

- **Frontend Monitoring:** Browser Performance API + Web Vitals + Custom metrics
- **Error Tracking:** Client-side error collection with structured reporting
- **Performance Monitoring:** Real User Monitoring (RUM) for Core Web Vitals
- **Usage Analytics:** Privacy-focused usage tracking for feature adoption

## Key Metrics

**Frontend Metrics:**
- **Core Web Vitals:** First Contentful Paint, Largest Contentful Paint, Cumulative Layout Shift, First Input Delay
- **JavaScript Errors:** Runtime errors, validation failures, file operation failures
- **API Response Times:** File system operations, validation processing time
- **User Interactions:** Element creation, property modifications, import/export usage

**Application-Specific Metrics:**
- **batchUpdate Complexity:** Number of requests per project, validation time
- **File Operation Performance:** Import/export success rates, file sizes processed
- **Validation Metrics:** Error rates by validation rule, most common validation failures
- **User Journey Metrics:** Time to first element creation, export completion rates
