# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for Alkemy GSlide, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**Decision: N/A - Greenfield project** with clear technology direction already established in PRD.

After reviewing the PRD requirements, this appears to be a greenfield project with specific technology preferences indicated:
- **Next.js** explicitly mentioned for rapid iteration
- **Tailwind CSS** specified for modern UI styling  
- **Client-side processing** requirement (no backend authentication needed)
- **Split-screen UI** with real-time preview capabilities
