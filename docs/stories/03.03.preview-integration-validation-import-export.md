# Story 03.03: Preview Integration, Validation UI & Import/Export

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** Google Slides API developer,
**I want** bi-directional selection between editor and preview with complete import/export functionality,
**so that** I can seamlessly work between visual and code representations while maintaining full data portability with validation feedback.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Bi-directional selection syncs between operation cards and preview elements with cyan glow
2. Animated connection lines show relationships between panels during selection
3. Validation errors display with red pulse animations inline and in status bar
4. Success states trigger particle effects and glow bursts
5. Import drag-zone shows border dance animation and accepts JSON/Markdown files
6. Export supports both JSON and Markdown formats with format toggle
7. Import validates structure and shows inline errors without overwriting valid data
8. Export is blocked when validation errors exist
9. Status bar displays live operation count and global validation state
10. All animations maintain 60 FPS performance

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Stories 3.1 and 3.2 established the operation list and editing modals. This story completes the Epic 3 feature set by connecting all components and adding the import/export layer.

### Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/components.md]:
- SlidePreviewRenderer handles preview panel rendering
- BatchUpdateEditor manages the editor panel
- Both components connect via Zustand store for state sync

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- Selection components: `src/components/editor/selection/`
  - `SelectionManager.tsx`
  - `ConnectionLines.tsx`
- Validation UI: `src/components/editor/validation/`
  - `ValidationStatusBar.tsx`
  - `ValidationIndicator.tsx`
  - `SuccessParticles.tsx`
- Import/Export: `src/components/file-operations/`
  - `ImportDropZone.tsx`
  - `ExportPanel.tsx`
  - `FormatToggle.tsx`
- Services: `src/services/`
  - Update `fileSystemService.ts` for new format support
  - Update `validationService.ts` for comprehensive validation
- Store updates: `src/stores/batchUpdateStore.ts`
- Tests: `tests/integration/workflows/` and `tests/e2e/specs/`

### Import/Export Specifications
From Epic 3 requirements:

**JSON Format:**
- Standard Google Slides batchUpdate array structure
- Direct serialization of operation objects

**Markdown Format:**
```markdown
# BatchUpdate Operations
Generated: [timestamp]

## Operation 1: [Type]
[Human-readable description]

```json
{operation_json}
```

## Operation 2: [Type]
...
```

### Validation Requirements
[Source: architecture/data-models.md & Epic 3]:
- All operations must have valid objectId references
- Coordinates must be within slide boundaries
- Color values must be valid RGB/RGBA
- Required fields must be present per operation type
- Export blocked if any validation errors exist

### Animation Specifications
From Epic 3 design requirements:
- Connection lines: Animate opacity and dash offset
- Error pulse: 2s ease-in-out infinite with scale(1.02)
- Success particles: Random burst pattern, 1s fade out
- Border dance: Rotating gradient border animation
- All animations respect prefers-reduced-motion

### File System APIs
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Use Browser File System API for file operations
- FileReader API for import parsing
- Blob API for export file creation
- Download via temporary anchor element

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Integration tests verify complete workflows
- E2E tests use Playwright for file upload/download
- Performance tests ensure 60 FPS using performance.now()
- Test file fixtures in `tests/fixtures/`

### Performance Considerations
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement virtual scrolling for large operation lists
- Debounce validation checks (300ms)
- Use CSS transforms for animations (GPU accelerated)
- Lazy load particle effects component
