# Story 03.02: Operation Editor Modal & Forms

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** Google Slides API developer,
**I want** to edit batchUpdate operations through a full-screen modal with dynamic forms and visual helpers,
**so that** I can accurately configure complex operations with auto-complete, coordinate pickers, and real-time validation feedback.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Full-screen modal overlay displays with 20px backdrop blur and glass-morphic central panel
2. Dynamic forms render based on operation type with appropriate fields
3. Coordinate picker includes visual grid overlay with snap-to-grid functionality
4. Auto-complete provides suggestions in glass dropdown panels
5. Input fields show neon focus borders matching the design system
6. Custom color picker displays neon palette options
7. Modal entrance uses scale animation from 0.9 with smooth transition
8. Form validation provides instant feedback without blocking input
9. All form interactions maintain accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 3.1 established the operation card structure that will trigger this modal. The modal should receive the operation data and type from the card click handler.

### Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/components.md]:
- BatchUpdateEditor manages operation state via Zustand
- ElementInspector component provides property editing patterns to reference
- Use controlled components pattern with Zustand store

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- Modal components: `src/components/editor/modals/`
  - `OperationEditorModal.tsx`
  - `CoordinatePicker.tsx`
  - `AutoCompleteField.tsx`
- Form components: `src/components/editor/forms/`
  - `CreateElementForm.tsx`
  - `UpdateElementForm.tsx`
  - `DeleteElementForm.tsx`
  - `TransformElementForm.tsx`
- Enhanced inputs: `src/components/ui/`
  - `NeonColorPicker.tsx`
  - `DimensionInput.tsx`
- Validation schemas: `src/lib/validations/operations/`
- Tests: `tests/components/editor/modals/` and `tests/components/editor/forms/`

### Technical Stack & Patterns
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Zod 4.1.5 for runtime validation
- Zustand for form state management
- shadcn/ui Dialog component as base for modal
- Tailwind CSS for styling with custom design tokens

### Google Slides API Types
[Source: architecture/data-models.md references]:
- Coordinate system uses EMU (English Metric Units)
- 1 inch = 914400 EMUs, 1 point = 12700 EMUs
- Standard slide dimensions: 10058400 x 5669300 EMUs
- Color format: RGB with optional alpha channel

### Form Field Specifications
Common fields by operation type:
- **Create**: elementProperties, size, transform, objectId
- **Update**: objectId, fields (updateMask), properties to update
- **Delete**: objectId, confirmation checkbox
- **Transform**: objectId, transform matrix or simple position/size

### Animation & Interaction Patterns
- Modal backdrop: animate opacity 0→1 (200ms)
- Modal panel: animate scale 0.9→1 and opacity 0→1 (250ms)
- Focus trap using focus-trap-react
- Form fields use immediate validation with debounce (300ms)

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Component tests verify form rendering and validation
- Integration tests check modal→store flow
- Accessibility tests using jest-axe
- Use React Testing Library user-event for interactions
