# Story 01.01: Project Setup and Core Architecture

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer working on Google Slides automation,
**I want** a properly configured Next.js application with split-screen layout and state management,
**so that** I have a solid foundation to build the visual batchUpdate editor upon.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Next.js 15.5 project is initialized with TypeScript 5.9.2 and configured with Bun 1.2.21 runtime
2. Tailwind CSS 4.1 and shadcn/ui CLI 3.0 components are properly configured and functional
3. Split-screen layout with resizable panels is implemented and responsive
4. Zustand 5.0.8 store is set up for batchUpdate state management with proper TypeScript types
5. Basic routing structure is established with main editor page
6. Dark mode theme with neon purple accents is configured following design specifications
7. Development environment is fully functional with hot reload and type checking
8. CI/CD pipeline is configured for Vercel deployment
9. Project follows established coding standards and folder structure from architecture document

## Dev Notes

### Architecture References
Based on docs/architecture.md:
- **Technology Stack**: Next.js 14.x, TypeScript 5.x, Bun 1.x, Tailwind CSS 3.x
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui with custom dark mode theme
- **State Management**: Zustand 4.x for lightweight batchUpdate state management
- **Deployment**: Vercel static site generation with global CDN

```

### Key Technical Requirements
- **Client-side only**: No backend dependencies
- **Performance targets**: < 2s first meaningful paint, < 100ms interactions
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Type safety**: Strict TypeScript with no `any` types

### Testing
**Test Framework**: Bun Test (built-in, faster than Vitest)
**Test Location**: `tests/` directory organized by component type
**Testing Standards**:
- Unit tests for pure functions and utilities
- Component tests using React Testing Library
- Integration tests for store and workflow interactions
- E2E tests using Playwright for critical user paths

**Specific Testing Requirements**:
- Test split-screen layout resizing functionality
- Test state management actions and persistence
- Test responsive behavior across breakpoints
- Test theme switching and accessibility features
