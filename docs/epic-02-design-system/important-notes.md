# Important Notes

- **Zero Tolerance for Design Debt**: Every specification must be implemented during initial development
- **Designer Approval Required**: Each story requires visual sign-off before completion
- **Performance is Non-Negotiable**: 60fps animations and < 100ms interactions are requirements, not goals
- **This Epic Blocks All UI Development**: No other visual components should be built until this foundation is complete
- **Investment in Excellence**: This epic represents the difference between a technical tool and a premium technical experience
