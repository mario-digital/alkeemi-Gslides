# Story Manager Handoff

---

**CRITICAL Story Manager Handoff:**

"This epic is ESSENTIAL to project success. The design specifications in docs/front-end-spec.md are NOT optional - they are requirements that define the entire user experience and brand positioning.

**Mandatory Implementation Standards:**
- Every color, font, animation, and component specification must be implemented exactly
- No 'close enough' approximations - hex codes, timing values, and measurements are precise requirements
- Design approval is required for each story before it can be marked complete
- Performance targets are not aspirational - they are measurable requirements

**Key Integration Points:**
- All foundation stories (01.x) must be updated to use this design system
- Every component created must follow the established design patterns
- Visual regression testing must prevent any design drift during development

**Designer Collaboration Required:**
- Design review checkpoints at completion of each story
- Visual comparison testing against specification
- User experience validation with target technical personas

This epic establishes the visual foundation that distinguishes Alkemy GSlide as a premium technical tool. There is zero tolerance for design debt or 'we'll polish it later' approaches."
