# Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Design implementation doesn't match specifications or performs poorly
- **Mitigation:** Detailed acceptance criteria with visual regression testing, performance monitoring, design review checkpoints
- **Rollback Plan:** Component-by-component implementation allows incremental rollback if issues arise
- **Quality Gates:** Each story requires design approval before completion
