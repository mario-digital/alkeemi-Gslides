# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Eliminate tedious, error-prone manual Google Slides API JSON coding
- Enable rapid prototyping and iteration of Google Slides layouts
- Provide real-time visual preview of batchUpdate configurations 
- Make slide automation accessible to non-technical creators (PMs, designers)
- Reduce development time for Google Slides automation projects
- Improve accuracy by reducing batchUpdate API errors due to malformed JSON

## Background Context

Currently, creating or customizing Google Slides via API (batchUpdate requests) requires advanced familiarity with JSON syntax, object structure, and the Slides API. This manual process is time-consuming, error-prone, and creates a steep learning curve that excludes non-technical team members from contributing to slide automation projects.

The market lacks a visual builder tool that bridges this gap between technical API requirements and user-friendly creation workflows. Alkemy GSlide addresses this critical need by providing an intuitive interface for composing, previewing, and exporting structured batchUpdate objects, making slide automation fast and accessible to both developers and business stakeholders.
