# Alkemy GSlide Foundation Epic - Greenfield Project

## Epic Title

Alkemy GSlide MVP Foundation - Visual Google Slides batchUpdate Builder

## Epic Goal

Create a production-ready visual builder that eliminates manual Google Slides batchUpdate JSON coding by providing an intuitive split-screen interface with real-time preview, enabling rapid slide automation development for both technical and non-technical users.

## Epic Description

**Project Context:**

- **Type:** Greenfield Next.js application 
- **Technology stack:** Next.js 15.5, TypeScript 5.9.2, Bun 1.2.21, shadcn/ui CLI 3.0, Tailwind CSS 4.1, Zustand 5.0.8
- **Architecture:** Client-side only static site with Vercel deployment
- **Target users:** Developers, PMs, designers working with Google Slides automation

**Enhancement Details:**

- **What's being built:** Complete visual builder application from scratch
- **Core functionality:** Split-screen interface (editor left, preview right) with drag-drop element creation, real-time validation, and batchUpdate JSON export
- **Integration approach:** Pure client-side processing with browser file APIs for import/export
- **Success criteria:** Users can create, preview, and export valid Google Slides batchUpdate JSON without manual coding

## Stories

This epic encompasses 3 foundational stories that establish the core MVP:

1. **Story 1:** Project Setup and Core Architecture
   - Initialize Next.js project with Bun runtime
   - Set up TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components  
   - Implement basic split-screen layout with resizable panels
   - Configure Zustand store for batchUpdate state management

2. **Story 2:** Visual Element Builder and Preview System
   - Create element toolbar with shape/text creation tools
   - Implement real-time preview canvas that renders batchUpdate requests
   - Build property panels for styling (colors, borders, positioning)
   - Add element selection and modification capabilities

3. **Story 3:** Import/Export and Validation System
   - Implement JSON validation using Zod schemas matching Google Slides API
   - Create file import system for existing batchUpdate configurations
   - Build export functionality for JSON and Markdown formats
   - Add real-time validation feedback with error highlighting

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Google Slides batchUpdate API compliance (primary requirement)
- [x] Modern browser support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [x] Responsive design for desktop/tablet usage
- [x] Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [x] No backend dependencies (client-side only)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Complex Google Slides API compliance and coordinate system accuracy
- **Mitigation:** Comprehensive Zod validation schemas, extensive testing with real API requests, coordinate system unit tests
- **Rollback Plan:** Static documentation site fallback if technical implementation blocks, progressive enhancement approach

## Definition of Done

- [x] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [x] Split-screen interface functional with smooth panel resizing  
- [x] Users can create basic shapes and text elements visually
- [x] Real-time preview accurately reflects batchUpdate JSON structure
- [x] Export generates valid JSON that works with Google Slides API
- [x] Import correctly loads and displays existing batchUpdate configurations
- [x] Comprehensive validation prevents invalid API configurations
- [x] Application deployed to Vercel with CI/CD pipeline
- [x] Basic user testing completed with target personas
- [x] Performance meets targets (< 2s first paint, < 100ms interactions)

## Validation Checklist

**Scope Validation:**

- [x] Epic delivers complete MVP functionality in 3 focused stories
- [x] No complex architectural decisions pending (architecture document complete)
- [x] Technical approach follows established Next.js/React patterns
- [x] Integration complexity is manageable (client-side only)

**Risk Assessment:**

- [x] Risk to project success is minimized through proven technology stack
- [x] Rollback plan provides graceful degradation options
- [x] Testing approach covers API compliance and user workflows
- [x] Team has expertise in required technologies (Next.js, TypeScript, React)

**Completeness Check:**

- [x] Epic goal delivers clear business value (eliminate manual JSON coding)
- [x] Stories are properly scoped and sequenced for iterative development
- [x] Success criteria are measurable and testable
- [x] Dependencies clearly identified (none blocking - pure frontend)

## Story Manager Handoff

**Story Manager Handoff:**

"Please develop detailed user stories for this greenfield epic. Key considerations:

- This is a brand new Next.js application with no existing codebase
- Technology stack: Next.js 15.5, TypeScript 5.9.2, Bun 1.2.21, shadcn/ui CLI 3.0, Tailwind CSS 4.1, Zustand 5.0.8
- Target deployment: Vercel static site with global CDN
- Critical requirements: Google Slides batchUpdate API compliance, real-time preview accuracy, intuitive UX for non-technical users
- Each story must include comprehensive acceptance criteria covering functionality, validation, and user experience
- Focus on iterative delivery - each story should provide demonstrable value
- Prioritize API compliance and validation throughout all development phases

The epic should establish a solid foundation for rapid Google Slides automation development while maintaining the highest standards for code quality, user experience, and API compliance."

---

## Success Criteria

The epic creation is successful when:

1. ✅ Complete MVP scope is clearly defined and appropriately sized for 3 stories
2. ✅ Technical approach leverages modern frontend patterns and proven technologies  
3. ✅ User experience prioritizes intuitive workflows for both technical and non-technical users
4. ✅ Stories are logically sequenced for safe iterative development
5. ✅ API compliance requirements are clearly specified with validation strategy
6. ✅ Performance and accessibility standards are established and measurable

## Important Notes

- This epic establishes the foundation for the complete Alkemy GSlide application
- Future epics will build on this foundation with advanced features (templates, collaboration, etc.)
- Prioritize API compliance and validation accuracy over feature richness in MVP
- User testing should begin early in Story 2 to validate core workflow assumptions
