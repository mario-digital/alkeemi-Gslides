# Epic 3: Interactive BatchUpdate Editor with Neon UI - Brownfield Enhancement 🎨✨

## Epic Goal

Implement a stunning interactive BatchUpdate operations editor with real-time visual preview, featuring our signature neon-infused dark interface that makes Google Slides API manipulation feel like wielding digital magic.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context

**Current relevant functionality:**
- Base split-screen layout implemented with dark theme
- JSON editor and preview panels in place
- Import/export shell structure exists
- Visual element builder from Epic 1 complete
- Preview system from Epic 2 operational

**Technology stack:**
- Next.js 14 with TypeScript
- React 18 with Server Components
- Tailwind CSS with custom neon design tokens
- shadcn/ui components with glass-morphic modifications
- Monaco Editor for JSON editing
- Zod for validation

**Integration points:**
- Existing preview canvas system
- Current import/export infrastructure
- Established validation framework
- Design system components from Epics 1 & 2

### Enhancement Details

**What's being added/changed:**

1. **Interactive Operations List (Left Panel)**
   - Glass-morphic operation cards with neon borders
   - Drag-and-drop reordering with trail effects
   - Color-coded by operation type (create=green, update=cyan, delete=pink)
   - Real-time validation with error pulse animations

2. **Operation Editor Modal**
   - Full-screen glass overlay with backdrop blur
   - Dynamic forms per operation type
   - Coordinate picker with visual grid overlay
   - Auto-complete with glass dropdown panels

3. **Enhanced Preview Integration**
   - Bi-directional selection with cyan glow connections
   - Element highlighting with neon outlines
   - Real-time sync between editor and preview
   - Connection animations between panels

4. **Import/Export Polish**
   - Drag-and-drop zone with neon glow and animated border effects for importing/exporting files
   - Progress feedback during import/export with particle effects and smooth transitions
   - Format toggle allowing users to switch between JSON and Markdown export, with a sliding neon indicator for the active format
   - Success/error states with visual feedback, including animated checkmarks for success and pulse/shake for errors
   
   **On Import:**
   - Dropping or selecting a file immediately attempts to load and parse the batchUpdate structure
   - **If the import is valid:**
     - Operations list (left panel) auto-populates with the imported operations
     - Visual preview (right panel) updates in real time to reflect imported state
     - All fields in operation cards/forms update to match imported data
     - A "success" animation plays, and import is complete
   - **If the import is invalid:**
     - No data is applied or overwritten
     - All errors are shown inline per operation and globally
     - A "failure" animation and error state is displayed in the UI
     - Users are prompted to fix the file and try again—export remains blocked until fixed
   
   **On Export:**
   - Export actions always serialize the current batchUpdate state (from the left panel) to either:
     - JSON (standard batchUpdate API array)
     - Markdown (using the documented export format: header, description, and fenced JSON code block)
   - Export is only allowed when all operations are valid; otherwise, the export button is disabled with visible error state
   - Export success triggers a glowing animation and saves the file using the user-specified filename and format
   - File Import/Export never overwrites user settings or unrelated state

5. **Validation System UI**
   - Inline error highlighting with red pulse
   - Global status bar with glass effect
   - Success particles on validation pass
   - Error shake animations

**How it integrates:**
- Builds on existing preview canvas from Epic 2
- Extends current import/export structure
- Leverages established design system tokens
- Uses existing validation framework with enhanced UI

**Success criteria:**
- All interactions respond within 100ms
- 60 FPS maintained for all animations
- Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance in dark mode
- Operation creation completed in < 30 seconds
- Zero visual glitches or layout shifts

## Stories

### Story 1: Operations List & Card Components
**Description:** Implement the glass-morphic operation cards with drag-and-drop functionality, including all visual states, animations, and the floating add button with gradient effects.

**Key Design Requirements:**
- Glass panels with `rgba(26, 26, 46, 0.85)` background
- Operation-type color coding with 30% opacity borders
- Hover states with glow intensification and 4px lift
- Drag animations with trail effects and slight rotation
- Entry animations: slide from left with 300ms fade
- Floating add button with pulse animation

### Story 2: Operation Editor Modal & Forms
**Description:** Create the modal editor system with dynamic forms for each operation type, including field validation, auto-complete, and coordinate picker with visual feedback.

**Key Design Requirements:**
- Full-screen overlay with 20px backdrop blur
- Central glass panel with gradient background
- Input fields with neon focus borders
- Custom color picker with neon palette
- Visual coordinate grid with snap-to-grid
- Scale entrance animation from 0.9

### Story 3: Preview Integration & Validation UI
**Description:** Implement bi-directional selection between editor and preview, real-time validation feedback, and the complete import/export experience with all animations.

**Key Design Requirements:**
- Cyan glow for selected elements
- Animated connection lines between panels
- Validation error states with red pulse
- Success particles and glow bursts
- Import drag-zone with border dance animation
- Export button with gradient and disabled states
- Status bar with live operation count

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing preview canvas APIs remain unchanged
- [x] Current import/export structure preserved
- [x] Design system tokens extended, not replaced
- [x] Validation framework enhanced with UI layer only
- [x] Performance targets maintained (< 2s load, 60 FPS)

## Risk Mitigation

**Primary Risk:** Complex animations impacting performance on lower-end devices

**Mitigation:** 
- Use CSS-only animations where possible
- Implement `prefers-reduced-motion` support
- GPU acceleration with `will-change` property
- Virtual scrolling for large operation lists

**Rollback Plan:** 
- Feature flag for new UI components
- Fallback to simplified animations
- Progressive enhancement approach

## Definition of Done

- [x] All three stories completed with design specifications met
- [x] Existing preview and import/export functionality verified
- [x] All animations running at 60 FPS
- [x] WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verified with axe-core
- [x] Responsive design working across all breakpoints
- [x] No regression in existing Epic 1 & 2 features
- [x] All neon effects and glass-morphic styles implemented
- [x] Keyboard shortcuts and touch gestures functional
- [x] Documentation updated with new component specs

**Story Manager Handoff:**

Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This is an enhancement to an existing system running Next.js 14, React 18, Tailwind CSS with custom neon design system
- Integration points: Preview canvas system, import/export infrastructure, validation framework, existing design components
- Existing patterns to follow: Glass-morphic panels, neon color system, 60 FPS animations, dark mode first
- Critical compatibility requirements: Maintain existing APIs, preserve current functionality, extend (don't replace) design tokens
- Each story must include verification that existing functionality remains intact

The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering a stunning interactive BatchUpdate editor that makes API manipulation feel magical through our signature neon aesthetic.
