## Story Manager Handoff

---

**CRITICAL Story Manager Handoff:**

"This epic is ESSENTIAL to project success. The design specifications in docs/front-end-spec.md are NOT optional - they are requirements that define the entire user experience and brand positioning.

**Mandatory Implementation Standards:**
- Every color, font, animation, and component specification must be implemented exactly
- No 'close enough' approximations - hex codes, timing values, and measurements are precise requirements
- Design approval is required for each story before it can be marked complete
- Performance targets are not aspirational - they are measurable requirements

**Key Integration Points:**
- All foundation stories (01.x) must be updated to use this design system
- Every component created must follow the established design patterns
- Visual regression testing must prevent any design drift during development

**Designer Collaboration Required:**
- Design review checkpoints at completion of each story
- Visual comparison testing against specification
- User experience validation with target technical personas

This epic establishes the visual foundation that distinguishes Alkemy GSlide as a premium technical tool. There is zero tolerance for design debt or 'we'll polish it later' approaches."

## Success Criteria

The epic is successful when:

1. ✅ **100% Design Specification Compliance** - Every element in front-end-spec.md implemented exactly
2. ✅ **Performance Standards Met** - All timing, loading, and interaction targets achieved
3. ✅ **Premium Visual Quality** - Interface communicates technical competence and reliability
4. ✅ **Accessibility Excellence** - WCAG 2.1 AA+ compliance verified
5. ✅ **Cross-Platform Consistency** - Perfect experience across devices and browsers
6. ✅ **Developer Experience** - Design system enables rapid, consistent component development

## Important Notes

- **Zero Tolerance for Design Debt**: Every specification must be implemented during initial development
- **Designer Approval Required**: Each story requires visual sign-off before completion
- **Performance is Non-Negotiable**: 60fps animations and < 100ms interactions are requirements, not goals
- **This Epic Blocks All UI Development**: No other visual components should be built until this foundation is complete
- **Investment in Excellence**: This epic represents the difference between a technical tool and a premium technical experience
