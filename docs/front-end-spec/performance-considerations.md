# Performance Considerations

## Performance Goals

- **Page Load:** < 2 seconds first meaningful paint
- **Interaction Response:** < 100ms for all user interactions
- **Animation FPS:** Consistent 60fps for all animations

## Design Strategies

Optimized dark mode reduces battery usage on OLED displays, lazy loading for complex JSON structures, and hardware-accelerated animations using CSS transforms and opacity.
