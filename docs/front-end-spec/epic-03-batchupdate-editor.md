# Epic 3: BatchUpdate Operations Editor - Front-End Specification 🎨✨

## Executive Summary

Building on our stunning neon-infused dark interface, Epic 3 transforms the BatchUpdate Operations Editor into an **interactive powerhouse**. We're creating a visual coding experience that makes Google Slides API manipulation feel like wielding digital magic - with every operation glowing, pulsing, and responding to your touch in real-time.

### Vision Statement
*"Where precision meets beauty - crafting slide operations becomes an art form with our neon-lit, glass-morphic interface that makes complex API calls feel like painting with light."*

## 🌟 Visual Design Direction

### The Neon Evolution Continues

Building on our established design language from Epics 1 & 2, we're introducing:

- **Operation Cards**: Glass-morphic cards with neon borders that pulse when active
- **Drag-and-Drop Magic**: Operations glow and leave neon trails when being reordered
- **Smart Validation**: Real-time error highlighting with electric red pulses
- **Interactive Preview**: Bi-directional selection with cyan highlights connecting editor to preview

### Color System Enhancement for Epic 3
