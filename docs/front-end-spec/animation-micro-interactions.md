# Animation & Micro-interactions

## Motion Principles

- **Purposeful Motion:** Every animation serves a functional purpose (feedback, guidance, state changes)
- **Neon Fluidity:** Smooth 60fps animations with glowing effects that feel premium
- **Responsive Timing:** Fast interactions (150-300ms) for immediate feedback, slower transitions (500ms+) for context changes
- **Accessibility-First:** Respects prefers-reduced-motion and provides non-motion alternatives

## Key Animations

- **Glow Pulse:** Subtle breathing effect on primary buttons and active elements (Duration: 2s, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Panel Slide:** Smooth panel entrance/exit with backdrop blur fade (Duration: 300ms, Easing: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1))
- **Validation Flash:** Success/error states with color washes and glow effects (Duration: 150ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Hover Elevation:** Cards lift with enhanced glowing shadows (Duration: 200ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Neon Border Draw:** Animated border that draws around focused elements (Duration: 400ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **JSON Syntax Highlight Fade:** Smooth color transitions for syntax highlighting (Duration: 100ms, Easing: linear)
- **Split Panel Resize Glow:** Enhanced glow effect during panel resizing (Duration: Continuous while dragging)
- **Element Preview Materialize:** New elements appear with scale and glow animation (Duration: 250ms, Easing: cubic-bezier(0.175, 0.885, 0.32, 1.275))
