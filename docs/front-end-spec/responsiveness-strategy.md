## Breakpoints

|------------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| Mobile | 320px | 767px | Smartphones (limited functionality) |
| Tablet | 768px | 1023px | Tablets, small laptops |
| Desktop | 1024px | 1439px | Standard desktops, laptops |
| Wide | 1440px | - | Large displays, ultrawide monitors |

## Adaptation Patterns

**Layout Changes:** Mobile collapses to single panel with tab switching, Desktop maintains split-screen

**Navigation Changes:** Mobile uses bottom navigation, Desktop uses top toolbar  

**Content Priority:** Mobile prioritizes preview over editor, Desktop shows both equally

**Interaction Changes:** Mobile uses touch-friendly controls, Desktop optimizes for mouse/keyboard
