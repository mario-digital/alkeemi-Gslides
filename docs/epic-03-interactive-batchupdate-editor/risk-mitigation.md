# Risk Mitigation

**Primary Risk:** Complex animations impacting performance on lower-end devices

**Mitigation:** 
- Use CSS-only animations where possible
- Implement `prefers-reduced-motion` support
- GPU acceleration with `will-change` property
- Virtual scrolling for large operation lists

**Rollback Plan:** 
- Feature flag for new UI components
- Fallback to simplified animations
- Progressive enhancement approach
